This is a Web App which I started building for my college students where they can get the reviews about the instructor and course. So that they can make a more informed decision about enrolling in a particular course.

But The project is not complete as I had to drop the idea because of lack of time due to other academic commitments.

But it works however the UI is is childish as its not my strongest suit but I have tried to make the backend robust and maintainabale it is implementd using SPRING MVC 3.0 and SPRING DATA.

For those who want to run and see how it actually looks you will be needing a MySql database. So I have included a database schema template normalized to 3NF along with a sql script which will create all the tables.
